**Find shelter or offer shelter in times of natural disasters.**

ShelterMe is a web app created to help people in the face of natural disasters. People have the ability to choose whether they are searching for shelter or offering shelter. 

People searching for shelter have the ability to enter their location, how many people are with them and the range they are willing to travel in. They are then presented with a map listing various shelters in their location range.

People offering shelter have the ability to enter their location, the number of people they can accommodate, meals they can supply, the duration they will let people stay, and whether or not they can accommodate people with special needs. They are then presented with a summary of all the information they have entered.
